# Hotel Booking EDA + Cancelation prediction 

### In This project we will apply techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover patterns in the data, and then apply basic machine learning methods to predict if a booking will be cancelled in the future or not 

The dataset includes all the bookings of two hotels along with information about the guests, the room types, check-in and check-out dates, etc

## Question/need:

 - From where the most guests are coming?
 - Which are the most busy months?
 - How long do people stay at the hotels?

## Data Description:
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things 
 - The dataset that we will used is [Hotel Booking dataset](https://github.com/maalakalmatrafi/Hotel-Booking-project/blob/main/hotel_bookings.csv) from Kaggle
