#  Hotel Booking EDA + Cancelation prediction

In This project we will apply techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover patterns in the data, and then apply basic machine learning methods to predict if a booking will be cancelled in the future or not
The dataset includes all the bookings of two hotels along with information about the guests, the room types, check-in and check-out dates, etc
